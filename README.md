# Hoverlight
React Native app to control the lamp Hoverlight

Right now the app has 2 pages : one to turn on/off the lamp and one to change its color
## On/Off page
It's just an animated page with a cute on/off switch.

## Color control
You can adjust the color of every LED on the lamp. Kinda fun to play with it.
